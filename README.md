# Contentstack and Google AMP Sample App

Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach that puts content at the centre. It is designed to simplify the process of publication by separating code from content.

## Tutorial

Google Accelerated Mobile Pages (Google AMP) is Google's back-end, open source HTML framework. It is specifically designed to help mobile-optimized content load instantly on all devices.
AMP-HTML is nothing but HTML5 with a certain set of specifications with optimization banked by JavaScript.
In this example, we have demonstrated how you can integrate Google AMP with Contentstack and create a sample website. 
The in-depth guide discusses how the website's performance can be improved with Contentstack and Google AMP.

The following screenshots show the outcome of the sample app on desktop and mobile versions.
